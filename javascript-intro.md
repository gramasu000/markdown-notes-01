# Javascript Introduction

These are my notes of [An Introduction to JavaScript](https://javascript.info/intro).

- Runs on web page load
- Integrates with HTML and CSS
- Programs written in Javascript are called scripts
- Javascript is also called Livescript or ECMAscript - not related to Java
- Javascript Engine - V8, Spidermonkey, Chakra, JavascriptCore, Nitro, SquirrelFish, etc.
- Engine parses javascript, compiles it to machine code and runs
- In-Browser Javascript can
  - Add new HTML to a page, update content, update CSS, etc.
  - Respond to user events - mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses
  - Perform network requests to the server that is the origin of the webpage
  - Download/Upload files
  - Get and Set cookies
  - User Input prompting/messaging
  - Local Storage
- In-Browser Javascript _cannot_
  - Read/Write files to the disk
  - Communicate with another tab/window if that tab/window is from another website
  - Perform network calls to servers other than the server of origin without explicit agreement (i.e. CORS headers)
- Most browsers support javascript and have it enabled by default
